This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
 1. Enter the number 1 to add a new car
 2. Enter the number 2 to display the current list of cars in order by year
 3. Enter the number 3 to quit the program
